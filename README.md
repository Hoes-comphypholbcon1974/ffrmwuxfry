Okay, so I just walked out of Black Bag, and wow, my brain feels like a hamster on a caffeine drip. Seriously, can someone explain why directors think it's okay to play tic-tac-toe with my emotions and then leave me hanging? I'm not even sure where to start. The opening scene was like someone opened the floodgates to chaos and just let it wash over us. And that red coat... was it supposed to symbolize lost childhood or just bad taste? I couldn't decide.

Anyway, the main guy, yeah, forgot his name already, does he not own a comb? And why was everyone whispering like they were trying not to wake a sleeping baby? Cranked up the tension, not gonna lie, but I had to strain my ears just to catch the dialogue. Maybe I'm just cranky from the lack of popcorn salt.

> So there's this bag, obviously black, and it's like... Pandora's box but with less intrigue and more dialogue heavy wit. Was it just me who thought the whole bag thing was over the top? Like, symbolizing the emptiness of modern life or lazy plot device?

There was this one part where the music swelled so much, I half expected a herd of elephants to appear and do a jig across the screen. But the plot twist (or whatever that was) around the middle is where things kind of hit a wall. Like driving a kiddie car into mud – you think you've got traction, but nope. 

Okay, inserting random code because apparently that's a thing. Don't even ask.

```c
int main() {
    printf(Does this make sense? No, it doesn’t.);
    return 0;
}
```

But then again, maybe I’m overthinking it. There’s something about the way the film forces you to reflect on your own life's black bag of messed-up memories. Kind of makes you want to download the movie and dissect every frame, doesn't it? Yet, I can't shake off that nagging question: Was that intentional, or did I just find meaning in a 2-hour serotonin rollercoaster? Watch the movie and get back to me, maybe I missed some secret message or plot point hidden in that black hole of a bag.
